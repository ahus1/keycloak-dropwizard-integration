# Preparing a proper Dropwizard Bundle for Keycloak

## What you can see here

This is a Dropwizard bundle that provides a ready-to-use Keycloak integration.

## Step by Step

This shows the main integration points

. Setup keycloak as an Authenticator to handle pre-auth integration:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.KeycloakBundle.java
-----
include::src/main/java/de/ahus1/keycloak/dropwizard/KeycloakBundle.java[tags=authenticator]
-----

. Setup the authentication factory
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.KeycloakBundle.java
-----
include::src/main/java/de/ahus1/keycloak/dropwizard/KeycloakBundle.java[tags=authfactory]
-----

## How to use it

Anyone who wants to use this will need register this bundle and will need to provide an own implementation derived from `KeycloakBundle` together with an class encapsulating the user's authentication that might be derived from `AbstractUser`.
Please see the next chapter how to integrate.
