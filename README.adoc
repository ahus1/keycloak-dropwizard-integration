http://keycloak.org[JBoss Keycloak^] provides a standalone OAuth 2.0 and Open ID Connect server.
It handles user credentials for your application, so you can focus on business requirements.

http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] is a Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services.

*TL;DR:* The module
https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs-example[keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs-example]
shows how to use Dropwizard's `@Auth` annotation with Keycloak using a full OAuth flow.

At the time I write this there is no open source integration of the two, so I set up this project.
See https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration for the latest version.

### How to use

The module `keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs` is a ready-to-use Dropwizard module.
The releases are available both from jcenter and Maven central:

### Prerequisites

These examples need a local JBoss Keycloak instance with Realm `test` and user `demo` with password `demo`.

Please download the Keycloak distribution matching your keycloak-dropwizard-integration version from http://keycloak.org and extract it to a subfolder `keycloak-server` of this directory.
Then call `keycloak-server.bat` to import an already configured realm. Using this startup file the configuration will be reset every time you start Keycloak.

### Parts

This example will guide you through setting up JBoss Keycloak in several configurations:

  * Simple Integration Servlet style for http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] +
    see  https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-dropwizard-jetty[module keycloak-dropwizard-jetty^].
  * Advanced Integration http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] style +
    see https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs[module keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs^]
    and https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs-example[module keycloak-dropwizard-example^].
  * Bearer-Only REST services for http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] +
    see https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-dropwizard-bearer[module keycloak-dropwizard-bearer^].

For completeness and as a very simple getting started a standard Servlet configuration is also included (without and with Keycloak):

  * Simple Servlet +
    see https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/simple-war[module simple-war^].
  * Servlet with Keycloak +
    see  https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-war[module keycloak-war^].
