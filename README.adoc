# Integration of Keycloak and Dropwizard

## About

### Summary

This project shows how JBoss Keycloak and Dropwizard can be used together.

ifdef::env-github[To read this tutorial fully rendered, please visit: https://ahus1.github.io/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tutorial.html.]

http://keycloak.org[JBoss Keycloak^] provides a standalone OAuth 2.0 and Open ID Connect server.
It handles user credentials for you application, so you can focus on business requirements.

http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] is a Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services.

*TL;DR:* The module
https://github.com/ahus1/keycloak-dropwizard-integration/tree/master/keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs[keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs]
shows how to use Dropwizard's `@Auth` annotation with Keycloak using a full OAuth flow.

At the time I write this there is no open source integration of the two, so I set up this project.

### Things to do

Over time the Sources in the module `keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs` will probably evolve to a ready-to-user Dropwizard module.

### Prerequisites

These examples need a local JBoss Keycloak instance with Realm `test` and user `demo` with password `demo`.

Please download the Keycloak distribution version 1.5.0 from http://keycloak.org and extract it to a subfolder `keycloak-server` of this directory.
Then call `keycloak-server.bat` to import an already configured realm. Using this startup file the configuration will be reset every time you start Keycloak.

### Parts

This example will guide you through setting up JBoss Keycloak in several configurations:

  * Simple Integration for http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] +
    see <<keycloak-dropwizard-jetty/README{ext-relative}#keycloak-dropwizard-jetty,module keycloak-dropwizard-jetty>>.
  * Advanced Integration http://dropwizard.io[Dropwizard^] +
    see <<keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs/README{ext-relative}#keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs,module keycloak-dropwizard-jaxrs>>.

For completeness and an even simple setup a standard Servlet configuration is also included (without and with Keycloak):

  * Simple Servlet +
    see <<simple-war/README{ext-relative}#simple-war,module simple-war>>.
  * Servlet with Keycloak +
    see <<keycloak-war/README{ext-relative}#keycloak-war,module keycloak-war>>.
